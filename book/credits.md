## How the book is made

This book is created using open source tools: it is a JupyterBook that is written using Markdown and Jupyter notebooks. Additional tooling is used from the [TeachBooks initiative](https://teachbooks.io/) to enhance the editing and reading experience. The files are stored on a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks-sphinx-tippy-Example). The website can be viewed at http://teachbooks.io/TeachBooks-sphinx-tippy-Example/. View the repository README file or contact the authors for additional information.
